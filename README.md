A group exercise for learning about distributed authoring, git, and github


Notes about playing in this experiment
* Our Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XKu7z9Km1HSHIW5EPYLT3EWsDzvzkW9J95_5YjaEjwk/edit?usp=drivesdk
* Because we're only using text, it's technically possible to fork and pull right through the browser. (But for the purposes of our experiment, we should avoid that technique, since it gets away from the aspect of git we're trying to explore.)

Wally's Cafe serves Lebanese food Monday through Saturday, closing at 10pm. They also have burgers and fries, but the lentil soup, schwarma, and felafel are not to be missed! They have a counter, and some outdoor seating. It's located behind the Bank Club, at the southern edge of Emeryville (near San Pablo and 40th). Cash only.
